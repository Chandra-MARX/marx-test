List of code use to run tests
=============================
You can inspect the code for all tests listed in the following to see exactly
what is tested. However, a direct copy and paste will not work because 
it depends on the local ``$PATH`` settings and other environment variables.
For example, we use a python function to manage the directory structure
for all the images generated by all the tests instead of giving the file
name directly to save images.

See :ref:`examples` for a few fully worked out examples of running |marx| with
detailed explanations of every step.
